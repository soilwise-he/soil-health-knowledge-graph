        dcterms:abstract "This repository hosts an open-source soil health knowledge graph (KG) alongside its supporting ontologies. The KG is designed to unify fragmented interpretations of soil health—a concept variably defined across research, policymaking, and agriculture—by structuring insights from the European Environment Agency's 2023 report Soil Monitoring in Europe: Indicators and Thresholds for Soil Health Assessments. The KG leverages SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) as its core framework to model soil health concepts, soil threat indicators and their critical thresholds, while Dublin Core standardizes metadata for references in the report. Relationships between entities are semantically defined using existing ontologies like Agrontology and OBO Relation Ontology. The KG is linked to external vocabularies such as AGROVOC and ISO 11074 (soil quality standard)."@en ;
