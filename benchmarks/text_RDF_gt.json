It has also been adopted in the Status of the world's soil resources report (FAO and ITPS, 2015). Soil threats are processes that damage soil and its functional properties. This damage then reduces the soil's capacity to provide ecosystem services. Spatial data on soil threats indicate focal areas for sensitive management and soil restoration (Huber et al., 2008). Soil threats are thus characterised by a negative trend in one or several soil properties (e.g. soil organic carbon (SOC) loss under cultivation, industrial pollutant inputs, water holding capacity), or are indicated directly by features observed in the field (e.g. erosion, sealing). Single threats typically affect different soil properties (physical, chemical and biological) or induce other threats (e.g. soil erosion is accompanied by SOC losses).",

Minimising or eliminating significant soil degradation is essential to maintain the services provided by all soils and is substantially more cost-effective than rehabilitating soils after degradation has occurred (FAO and ITPS, 2015).

At present, assessment of soil degradation according to the current state of research, can be carried out only for specific soil services. For these, it is imperative to consider, in addition to the general soil properties (or indicators) used in these models, specific regional conditions such as climate and crop type (example: regional versions of the S-Risk model).",

      "text": "Four main types of soil degradation are distinguished (Lal, 2015):\n•\tSoil physical degradation is a reduction in structural attributes, including pore geometry and continuity, thus aggravating a soil's susceptibility to crusting, compaction, reduced water infiltration, increased surface run-off, wind and water erosion, greater soil temperature fluctuations and an increased propensity for desertification. It also includes soil excavation and soil sealing.\n•\tSoil chemical degradation is characterised by changes in soil processes, including nutrient depletion, acidification, salinisation and contamination, which in turn leads to a reduced cation exchange capacity, increased aluminium or manganese toxicities, calcium or magnesium deficiencies, and leaching of nitrate nitrogen or other essential plant nutrients. For nutrients and contaminants, annual inputs, such as those from agricultural management (inputs of N, P, K and also copper, zinc, cadmium and antibiotics via animal manure, sewage sludge, compost, digestate or mineral fertilisers) or from additional sources, including inputs via air or sedimentation, are also considered chemical degradation.\n•\tSoil biological degradation refers to reduced soil biological activity, which can be accompanied by a loss of soil biodiversity. This leads to lower levels of mineralisation and respiration and an accumulation of incompletely decomposed dead organic matter (necromass). Nutrient availability is reduced, and organic matter accumulates in forest topsoils. In peat soils, degradation (cause by drainage) leads to SOC losses.\n•\tSoil ecological degradation: although a clear characterisation of soil ecological condition, and what is to be considered a reference, is largely lacking, ecological degradation reflects a combination of the other three types of degradation. This leads to a disruption in ecosystem functions, such as element cycling and water infiltration and purification, perturbations in the hydrological cycle and a decline in net biome productivity.",

      "text": "Regulation EU No 1306/2013 on the common agricultural policy (CAP) (EU, 2013b) introduced standards for good agricultural and environmental condition of the land (GAEC), which are linked to agricultural subsidies. Also important are the rural development measures as set out in the regulation. Three GAEC standards refer directly to soil, namely GAEC 4 'Minimum soil cover', GAEC 5 'Minimum land management reflecting site specific conditions to limit erosion', and GAEC 6 'Maintain soil organic matter through appropriate practices'. GAEC 4 requires that a cover of growing plants or other organic residues should remain on the soil surface to reduce erosion by water and wind. Member States set quantitative targets and report progress through annual implementation reports. The implementation of both the GAECs and the rural development measures in support of soil quality has been poor across the EU (EC, 2020a). The 2013 CAP regulation will be replaced by a new regulation for the CAP period 2023-2027. The new CAP lays down a common set of indicators as part of a new performance, monitoring and evaluation framework. The indicators will be monitored through annual performance reports and a biannual review of progress in implementing the CAP strategic plans.",

      "text": "SOM is the sum of all dead organic components at various stages of decomposition in a soil, which are made from basic elements including carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and an array of attached cations and ions. Some definitions also include undecayed plant and animal residues as well as microbial biomass. Since SOM is difficult to measure directly, it is common practice to measure and report SOC. Historically, a factor of 1.724 has been used to convert SOC to SOM, based on the assumption that organic matter is 58% carbon. However, a review by Pribyl (2010) shows that a factor of 2 would often be more accurate, especially in the case of soil layers rich in organic matter, such as on forest floors, because of differences related to the different stages of decomposition and mineralisation. To avoid such uncertainties, we recommend not converting at all but using SOC as measured.",
