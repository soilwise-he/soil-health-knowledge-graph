It has also been adopted in the Status of the world's soil resources report (FAO and ITPS, 2015). Soil threats are processes that damage soil and its functional properties. This damage then reduces the soil's capacity to provide ecosystem services. Spatial data on soil threats indicate focal areas for sensitive management and soil restoration (Huber et al., 2008). Soil threats are thus characterised by a negative trend in one or several soil properties (e.g. soil organic carbon (SOC) loss under cultivation, industrial pollutant inputs, water holding capacity), or are indicated directly by features observed in the field (e.g. erosion, sealing). Single threats typically affect different soil properties (physical, chemical and biological) or induce other threats (e.g. soil erosion is accompanied by SOC losses).",

It also includes soil excavation and soil sealing.\n•\tSoil chemical degradation is characterised by changes in soil processes, including nutrient depletion, acidification, salinisation and contamination, which in turn leads to a reduced cation exchange capacity, increased aluminium or manganese toxicities, calcium or magnesium deficiencies, and leaching of nitrate nitrogen or other essential plant nutrients. For nutrients and contaminants, annual inputs, such as those from agricultural management (inputs of N, P, K and also copper, zinc, cadmium and antibiotics via animal manure, sewage sludge, compost, digestate or mineral fertilisers) or from additional sources, including inputs via air or sedimentation, are also considered chemical degradation.\n•\tSoil biological degradation refers to reduced soil biological activity, which can be accompanied by a loss of soil biodiversity. This leads to lower levels of mineralisation and respiration and an accumulation of incompletely decomposed dead organic matter (necromass). Nutrient availability is reduced, and organic matter accumulates in forest topsoils. In peat soils, degradation (cause by drainage) leads to SOC losses.\n•\tSoil ecological degradation: although a clear characterisation of soil ecological condition, and what is to be considered a reference, is largely lacking, ecological degradation reflects a combination of the other three types of degradation. This leads to a disruption in ecosystem functions, such as element cycling and water infiltration and purification, perturbations in the hydrological cycle and a decline in net biome productivity.",

Although SOC content has already been widely used as an indicator of soil health, it is challenging to define thresholds for optimal or critical SOC content below which soil functions are hampered. This is because complex biochemical processes are involved in SOC turnover, including mineralisation and stabilisation. In addition, soil and environmental conditions vary profoundly across Europe. The SOC content reflects an interplay between vegetation, climate and soil; depending on the chemical composition of SOC, its binding with soil minerals and its storage within soil aggregates, SOC content can respond rapidly to climatic changes or changes induced by land management, in particular its labile fraction. Nowadays, a natural equilibrium under undisturbed conditions is rarely seen; however, the thresholds for the lowest SOC contents necessary to ensure soil health are barely understood. This makes it difficult to determine the level at which soils are degraded as a result of loss of SOC content. In this chapter, several approaches to defining such thresholds are summarised. They mostly rely on the relationship between SOC content and crop yield response in agricultural soils but also include the role of SOC in the structural stability of soils.",

SOM (as much as SOC) is today recognised as critical to preserving food security, and a decline in SOM levels leads to soil degradation because its loss is often followed by decreases in soil fertility and stability (Stolte et al., 2016).

Historically, a factor of 1.724 has been used to convert SOC to SOM, based on the assumption that organic matter is 58% carbon. However, a review by Pribyl (2010) shows that a factor of 2 would often be more accurate, especially in the case of soil layers rich in organic matter, such as on forest floors, because of differences related to the different stages of decomposition and mineralisation.

When SOC levels in soil are below 1%, soil health may be constrained and potential yields may not be achieved, while a minimum of 2% SOC is necessary to maintain structural soil stability, and, if SOC content is 1.2-1.5%, stability declines rapidly (Kay and Angers, 1999). Lopes et al. (2013) delineated a critical range of SOC for two soil orders: alfisols (corresponding largely to luvisols and lixisols in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources) with 0.5-0.77% SOC; and entisols (leptosols in the World Reference Base) with 1.03-1.16% SOC.",

Such values can be taken from more or less undisturbed soils under natural vegetation (e.g. forests) or modelled, which would theoretically represent the highest SOC stock a given soil can achieve ('reference SOC stocks', according to Batjes (2011)). Yet, taking this approach, nearly all arable soils would be classified as degraded, because SOC is inevitably lost when breaking a native sod. Barré et al. (2017) suggest that the 'highest reachable SOC stock for a given pedoclimatic condition under a given land-use could correspond to the mean of the top 10% of the measured SOC stocks for these conditions. For New Zealand, Sparling et al. (2003) proposed the median SOC for permanent grassland as a target value, and its 25th percentile as a minimum value. This is a pragmatic solution and can be easily determined. The 25th percentile is conservative and seems quite realistic. An example of derive modelled reference SOC stocks is Lugato et al. (2015), who produced a spatially explicit estimation of soil carbon storage potential in European arable soils by 2050, applying different management scenarios to the Century model framework.

(2021) identified maximum and mean values of SOC content for soils at risk of desertification, i.e. 1.5% for cropland.",

      "text": "In a recent study, Johannes et al. (2017) reviewed and investigated the role of soil structural parameters (aggregate stability, porosity, mechanical properties, penetration resistance) and soil texture and its relationship with soil organic matter. Their study was inspired by the work of Dexter et al. (2008), who studied the relationship between soil texture, in particular the clay content, and SOC content. They proposed that the optimum SOC content was 10% of the clay content, later specified by others as dispersible clay rather than total clay (e.g. Schjønning et al., 2012). This threshold was refined by Johannes et al. (2017), based on 161 samples representing a major part of the Swiss agricultural land (cambic luvisols) (Table 2.7). The threshold translates into a vulnerability limit: %SOC = 0.1*%clay. Prout et al. (2020) suggest a vulnerability limit of less than 1/13 as the threshold to indicate degradation because hardly any grassland and woodland sites fall into that category. Nevertheless, it seems that the SOC/clay ratio as an indicator of good soil structure applies to a wide range of soils and land uses (arable land, grassland and woodland), and can be used to monitor and understand the state of soils at larger scales. For England and Wales, Prout et al. (2020) found that 38.2%, 6.6% and 5.6% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded as a result of loss of SOC. The data correspond well with preliminary observations for Wallonia indicating degraded land with a SOC/clay ratio of 0.08, transitional land with SOC/clay ratios of between 0.08 and 0.1, and favourable and highly favourable land with SOC/clay ratios above 0.1 and 0.12, respectively (C. B. Chartin, Université Catholique de Louvain, personal communication, August, 2022).",

      "text": "Carbon sequestration is 'the process of transferring CO₂ from the atmosphere into the soil of a land unit, through plants, plant residues and other organic solids which are stored or retained in the unit as part of the soil organic matter with a long residence time' (Olson et al., 2014). Soils' potential to sequester carbon arises because historical management has depleted the carbon pool of many soils. And even nowadays, certain soils still lose carbon under current management in some areas of Europe, especially cultivated carbon-rich soils (drained organic soils) and soils that have undergone forest and grassland conversions.",

      "text": "When soils remained undisturbed, i.e. under prolonged native site conditions with climax vegetation, we can assume that the maximum level of SOC is stored. According to Sandermann et al. (2017), the identification of historically degraded land indicates where new carbon can be stored now and in the future. Currently, soil degradation from SOC decline becomes apparent through yield gaps or yield decreases relative to a benchmark; however, there are various causes of such yield effects, as the decline in SOC content depends significantly on local conditions. Commonly, especially amongst farmers, the full range of SOC's ecosystem services (including stabilisation, protection from climate change and the improved water dynamics of SOC-enriched soils) is still hardly accounted for, and any SOC loss is rarely noticed (Hijbeek et al., 2017b). This is probably the reason why available soil degradation maps which focus only on the production functions of soils, are not considered reliable (Gibbs and Salmon, 2015; Amelung et al., 2020).",

(1998) evaluated long-term field experiments (begun in 1902), which included treatments to study the influence of a large spectrum of SOM contents on yield and C and N dynamics. The authors propose an upper limit for SOM content, above which there is an increased risk of nitrogen and CO₂ loss; lower limits represent the SOM level required to maintain optimum crop production. These limit values increase with increasing clay content, i.e. from 1% SOM at 4% clay up to 3.5% SOM at 38% clay (Table 2.8). This means that, even with the addition of fertiliser, below 1% SOM, mineralisable nitrogen is so low that potential optimal yields can no longer be achieved. Soils under the influence of groundwater have been excluded from these considerations. For comparability, initial SOM values were converted to SOC using the factor 1.724.",

      "text": "When applying farmers' perception of SOC depletion as a threshold, very little cropland is identified as 'degraded' in most of the intensively managed agricultural areas in Europe. This low threshold largely considers SOC in relation to yield dynamics, and excludes the role of SOC for other ecosystem services. It is obvious that the initial SOC content of uncultivated soils under permanent vegetation cover was originally much higher. Soils — through cultivation — have lost more than 50% of their initial carbon stock. This indicates that cropland soils have already lost a significant amount of their potential to deliver soil functions so that, in theory, many cropland soils could be perceived as SOC degraded. However, this loss of soil function, and the regaining of soil functioning with increasing SOC, is still difficult to quantify (see also Wiesmeier et al., 2019).",

The definition of optimum SOC stocks is difficult, even if achievable, because optimum SOC content is not only site specific but possibly also different for the various soil functions.",
