It has also been adopted in the Status of the world's soil resources report (FAO and ITPS, 2015). Soil threats are processes that damage soil and its functional properties. This damage then reduces the soil's capacity to provide ecosystem services. Spatial data on soil threats indicate focal areas for sensitive management and soil restoration (Huber et al., 2008). Soil threats are thus characterised by a negative trend in one or several soil properties (e.g. soil organic carbon (SOC) loss under cultivation, industrial pollutant inputs, water holding capacity), or are indicated directly by features observed in the field (e.g. erosion, sealing). Single threats typically affect different soil properties (physical, chemical and biological) or induce other threats (e.g. soil erosion is accompanied by SOC losses).",

Three GAEC standards refer directly to soil, namely GAEC 4 'Minimum soil cover', GAEC 5 'Minimum land management reflecting site specific conditions to limit erosion', and GAEC 6 'Maintain soil organic matter through appropriate practices'. GAEC 4 requires that a cover of growing plants or other organic residues should remain on the soil surface to reduce erosion by water and wind. Member States set quantitative targets and report progress through annual implementation reports. The implementation of both the GAECs and the rural development measures in support of soil quality has been poor across the EU (EC, 2020a). The 2013 CAP regulation will be replaced by a new regulation for the CAP period 2023-2027.

      "text": "Sufficient soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key element of healthy soils, affecting the quality of water, air, biodiversity and, ultimately, food and water security. Although SOC content has already been widely used as an indicator of soil health, it is challenging to define thresholds for optimal or critical SOC content below which soil functions are hampered. This is because complex biochemical processes are involved in SOC turnover, including mineralisation and stabilisation. In addition, soil and environmental conditions vary profoundly across Europe. The SOC content reflects an interplay between vegetation, climate and soil; depending on the chemical composition of SOC, its binding with soil minerals and its storage within soil aggregates, SOC content can respond rapidly to climatic changes or changes induced by land management, in particular its labile fraction. Nowadays, a natural equilibrium under undisturbed conditions is rarely seen; however, the thresholds for the lowest SOC contents necessary to ensure soil health are barely understood. This makes it difficult to determine the level at which soils are degraded as a result of loss of SOC content. In this chapter, several approaches to defining such thresholds are summarised. They mostly rely on the relationship between SOC content and crop yield response in agricultural soils but also include the role of SOC in the structural stability of soils.",

Hence, SOM also affects the storage and release of nutrients and heavy metals, and it contributes to soil acidity (forest floors, Podsols) or its buffering (Blume et al., 2016). With regard to greenhouse gases, soils can, under certain conditions, sequester carbon and thus contribute to climate change mitigation, removing CO₂ from the atmosphere (IPCC, 2019b).",

Assuming that a C/N ratio of 12 is maintained in an agricultural soil, for instance, this means that to sequester 12 tonnes of SOC 1 tonne of nitrogen must be sequestered, or, vice versa, losing SOC inevitably entails a loss of soil nitrogen (Van Groenigen et al., 2017). Nitrogen affects the composition of microbial communities (e.g. proportion of fungi and bacteria), root turnover and the chemical composition of SOM. SOM (research is nowadays focused on SOC) is thus an important indicator to regulate the need for nitrogenous fertilisers. SOM may become a source of nitrogen, particularly during winter in agricultural fields, while the presence of SOM with a higher C/N ratio may also contribute to minimising environmental pollution (Musinguzi et al., 2013) due to microbial immobilisation processes. The C/N ratio of SOM finally affects the need for fertiliser nitrogen (Schjønning et al., 2018) as well as dissolved organic matter formation (Kindler et al., 2011) and nitrous oxide release (Mu et al., 2009). Establishing critical SOM (or SOC) levels or thresholds may help to restore SOC-depleted (and nitrogen-depleted) soils. Also, the relationship between SOC and soil fertility and crop yield (which is predominantly positive) has now become the basis for identifying SOC sequestration potentials (Amelung et al., 2020).",

(2017) reviewed and investigated the role of soil structural parameters (aggregate stability, porosity, mechanical properties, penetration resistance) and soil texture and its relationship with soil organic matter. Their study was inspired by the work of Dexter et al. (2008), who studied the relationship between soil texture, in particular the clay content, and SOC content. They proposed that the optimum SOC content was 10% of the clay content, later specified by others as dispersible clay rather than total clay (e.g. Schjønning et al., 2012). This threshold was refined by Johannes et al. (2017), based on 161 samples representing a major part of the Swiss agricultural land (cambic luvisols) (Table 2.7). The threshold translates into a vulnerability limit: %SOC = 0.1*%clay. Prout et al. (2020) suggest a vulnerability limit of less than 1/13 as the threshold to indicate degradation because hardly any grassland and woodland sites fall into that category. Nevertheless, it seems that the SOC/clay ratio as an indicator of good soil structure applies to a wide range of soils and land uses (arable land, grassland and woodland), and can be used to monitor and understand the state of soils at larger scales. For England and Wales, Prout et al. (2020) found that 38.2%, 6.6% and 5.6% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded as a result of loss of SOC. The data correspond well with preliminary observations for Wallonia indicating degraded land with a SOC/clay ratio of 0.08, transitional land with SOC/clay ratios of between 0.08 and 0.1, and favourable and highly favourable land with SOC/clay ratios above 0.1 and 0.12, respectively (C.

Soils' potential to sequester carbon arises because historical management has depleted the carbon pool of many soils.

These limit values increase with increasing clay content, i.e. from 1% SOM at 4% clay up to 3.5% SOM at 38% clay (Table 2.8). This means that, even with the addition of fertiliser, below 1% SOM, mineralisable nitrogen is so low that potential optimal yields can no longer be achieved.

In addition, it affects the diversity of soil microorganisms, soil animals and plant species, which can be positive or negative. In general, a high nitrogen status reduces the diversity but the increase in other nutrients may either increase or decrease diversity.

In non-agricultural systems (i.e. forestry), biomass growth is thus enhanced by additional inputs. At a certain level, however, this production increase will also adversely affect plant species diversity, and it may cause losses of N and P to water, where they may cause eutrophication (see Section 3.1.3), and growth may even be reduced at very high levels of inputs (see Section 3.1.2).

While there is usually a chemical equilibrium between available and reactive ions and those in the soil solution (a prerequisite for deriving thresholds based on simple nutrient concentration analysis), no such equilibrium exists for N. Instead, biologically mediated processes affect the availability of N to crops in agricultural soils. Important soil parameters affecting soil N availability include pH, organic matter and clay content. When N is added to soil, a part is consumed by vegetation, and the N surplus is emitted to air, as ammonia (NH₃), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N₂O) or dinitrogen (N₂), or to groundwater and surface water, mainly as nitrate (NO₃⁻), or it accumulates in soil (Figure 3.1); however, the long-term change in the stock of organic soil N is very limited.

A meta-analysis of the yield response to long-term phosphorous fertilisation from 30 field experiments in Germany and Austria showed a strong decline in the magnitude of the yield response with increasing soil P content, with no effect at high soil P status (Buczko et al., 2018).

      "text": "Plant protection products (PPPs) are largely introduced to soil as part of common agricultural practices. Consequently, a series of PPPs, mainly herbicides, can be found in soil, groundwater and drinking water. Whether or not a chemical is of concern in groundwater and surface water bodies after being introduced to soil depends on its chemical stability (or persistence) and mobility, i.e. the degree to which chemicals can migrate with percolating water. Both stability and mobility are part of the registration procedure (aside from toxicity testing as such), and in most European countries the application and leaching of PPPs is regulated (type of chemical to be used as well as its application (Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009; EU, 2009). For most 'modern' PPPs, SSVs are not in place, since regulation is based on the principle that the concentration of the chemical will decrease to non-toxic levels within a prescribed time interval. Instead, limit values are developed for groundwater and surface water based on human health or toxicological criteria. However, despite the improved regulatory framework for new PPPs, concentrations can still exceed the detection limit (which often is used as threshold level) in surface water and/or groundwater. Especially in countries with shallow groundwater tables such as Belgium, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, many PPPs are found in most groundwater abstraction wells. Various applications also lead to a significant accumulation of metals (e.g. copper from herbicides). Soil screen values are available for PPPs used in the past that are less mobile and hence tend to accumulate in soil (e.g. for chemicals such as DDT and other persistent organic pollutants).",

      "text": "Currently, there is concern about emerging chemical substances in soils. These are substances not previously considered or known to be significant in the environment and typically have no regulatory standards. The Norman network currently lists 860 substances in the aquatic environment (i.e. surface waters and to a lesser extent groundwater), of which some are prioritised, forming the basis for the first EU watch list of emerging pollutants, most of them organic (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/495; EU, 2015). Substances of emerging concern include PFAS, nanoparticles, antibiotics and other medicinal products such as anthelmintics. PFAS include more than 4,700 different substances (OECD, 2013), which are of very high concern because of their high environmental persistence and toxicity. Soil and groundwater pollution with PFAS has become evident in Europe (EEA, 2022a). Among other substances, contaminated sewage sludges used as organic fertiliser have caused PFAS pollution of soil (Ghisi et al., 2019). As a first step to monitor its accumulation, background concentrations for mobile forms of PFAS have been determined for PFOA or perfluorooctane sulphonic acid (PFOS). A limit value of 0.1µg/l for each individual PFAS in drinking water (or a total concentration of 0.5µg/l for the entire PFAS group) has been introduced (EU, 2020). Based on preliminary human toxicological data (human tolerable daily intake, TDI), several Member States have also developed SSVs for PFAS (e.g. Netherlands and Germany). These, however, are not comparable, since the German values are based on a maximum concentration in a soil extract, whereas the Dutch values are based on measurements of the total concentration in the soil solid phase.",

Since then, the work has been taken further by the European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet) Thematic Group Soil, based on questionnaires (EEA, 2022c).",

An extended rationale for these parameters and indicators related to diffuse pollution can be found in Van-Camp et al. (2004b). They suggest that the following metals and nutrients could be realistically monitored, recommending 5- to 10-year sampling intervals:\n•\theavy metals (cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, arsenic, nickel and chromium);\n•\tnutrients (nitrogen and phosphates).",

An active microbiome and below-ground food web controls the energy transformations and nutrient turnover of ecosystems. The aim of this chapter is to describe current approaches for defining loss of soil biodiversity at the European level. Species diversity may seem, by definition, a robust indicator of the health of soil communities. However, there is a general lack of knowledge about the status of soil biodiversity and its baselines. While an enormous number of soil-dwelling species are still undescribed, experimental evidence is also lacking for the critical role of functionally relevant (flagship) species and the effects of their loss. Rather than net species numbers, research is currently focusing on the interactions between functional groups of organisms and their abiotic environment. Although it is currently impossible to measure soil biodiversity quantitatively and accurately as a whole, or to assess its health or level of degradation, it can be approximated using combinations of sub-indicators.",

This reduces hydraulic conductivity and rainwater infiltration, which reduces groundwater recharge, while increasing the likelihood of waterlogging. The last hampers rooting and soil biological activity. Consequently, soil biochemical processes are affected, including nutrient turnover and greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide, methane). As a result, plant health, and thus food and fibre production, are adversely affected. Compaction is also known to trigger soil erosion. Operations at critical soil moisture levels, and the use of increasingly heavy machinery, cause compaction, which is particularly damaging in the subsoil. While topsoil compaction can be ameliorated through tillage and bioturbation from plants rooting and soil fauna burrowing, subsoil compaction is cumulative, often persistent and requires significant technical effort to alleviate. Therefore, subsoil compaction is often perceived as irreversible.",
