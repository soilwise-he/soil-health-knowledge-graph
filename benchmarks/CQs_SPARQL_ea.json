        "expected_answer": "The main onsite effect of soil erosion is the reduction in soil quality, induced by the loss of fertile topsoil, and this includes soil carbon. The eroded material is damaging buildings, adjacent properties and other infrastructure. Eroded soil is also known to clog up drainage systems, which could result in overflow and wash-out and subsequently their failure. If coupled with poor drainage maintenance, soil erosion can affect the lifetime of pavements (e.g. deformation, frost heave)."

Various proxy or impact (sub-)indicators are used to estimate the severity of erosion and a potential soil erosion rate. These include land use information, dimensions of erosion features, increased turbidity in run-off, amount of deposition and exposure of subsoil, amount of sediments or other indirect parameters such as changes in soil depth, reduced organic matter content, exposure of plant roots, and changes in soil texture."

        "sparql_query": "",
        "expected_answer": "Soil compaction harms the physical structure of soils and thus affects important ecological and economic soil functions, by reducing pore volume and pore continuity as well as particle surface accessibility. This reduces hydraulic conductivity and rainwater infiltration, which reduces groundwater recharge, while increasing the likelihood of waterlogging. Consequently, soil biochemical processes are affected, including nutrient turnover and greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide, methane). As a result, plant health, and thus food and fibre production, are adversely affected. Operations at critical soil moisture levels, and the use of increasingly heavy machinery, cause compaction."

        "expected_answer": " Soil compaction occurs primarily if the internal soil strength (known as actual precompression stress) is exceeded by additional stress, for example from heavy machinery, dense trafficking and driving when soil moisture content is high.

The extent to which these changes occur depends on the stress intensity and duration as well as the kind of stress applied (static or cyclic stress due to wheeling and induced shear effects). In addition, physico-chemical processes are affected, such as redox potential, mobility of ions and related effects on the pH value of the soil."

The values for the precompression stress are determined under laboratory conditions and often quantified when the soil is most sensitive (usually in early spring at matric potential values of pF1.8 = -60hPa, or when drying due to evapotranspiration reduces the soil water content (pF2.5 or -300hPa matric potential)."
