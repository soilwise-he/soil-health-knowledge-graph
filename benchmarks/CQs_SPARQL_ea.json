According to Montgomery (2007), the soil naturally develops at an average rate of 0.173mm/year resulting in an increase of 2.2t/ha/year. Verheijen et al.

        "sparql_query": "",
        "expected_answer": "Soil compaction harms the physical structure of soils and thus affects important ecological and economic soil functions, by reducing pore volume and pore continuity as well as particle surface accessibility. This reduces hydraulic conductivity and rainwater infiltration, which reduces groundwater recharge, while increasing the likelihood of waterlogging. Consequently, soil biochemical processes are affected, including nutrient turnover and greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide, methane). As a result, plant health, and thus food and fibre production, are adversely affected. Operations at critical soil moisture levels, and the use of increasingly heavy machinery, cause compaction."

        "sparql_query": "",
        "expected_answer": " Soil compaction occurs primarily if the internal soil strength (known as actual precompression stress) is exceeded by additional stress, for example from heavy machinery, dense trafficking and driving when soil moisture content is high. Precompression stress indicates the soil's site-specific natural ability to bear and recover from external mechanical forces."

        "expected_answer": "Compaction increases the penetration resistance of the soil, while root growth and biological activity, like the frequency of earthworms, nematodes or collembolans, are reduced. The extent to which these changes occur depends on the stress intensity and duration as well as the kind of stress applied (static or cyclic stress due to wheeling and induced shear effects). In addition, physico-chemical processes are affected, such as redox potential, mobility of ions and related effects on the pH value of the soil."

The values for the precompression stress are determined under laboratory conditions and often quantified when the soil is most sensitive (usually in early spring at matric potential values of pF1.8 = -60hPa, or when drying due to evapotranspiration reduces the soil water content (pF2.5 or -300hPa matric potential)."
