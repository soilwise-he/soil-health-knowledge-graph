      "text": "In order to manage soil sustainably, and protect it where necessary, knowledge is needed about the state of soil and how it develops under current and future management and climatic conditions. Healthy soils deliver ecosystem services to the best of their capacity. Unquestionable evidence shows that land cultivation and urbanisation have altered many soil properties, causing reduced soil functioning (JRC, 2012; EC, 2020a). Such soils are then degraded, which consequently harms ecosystems and their life support functions. In the case of soil sealing, soil functions are largely and irreversibly lost.",
