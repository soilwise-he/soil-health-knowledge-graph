      "text": "In order to manage soil sustainably, and protect it where necessary, knowledge is needed about the state of soil and how it develops under current and future management and climatic conditions. Healthy soils deliver ecosystem services to the best of their capacity. Unquestionable evidence shows that land cultivation and urbanisation have altered many soil properties, causing reduced soil functioning (JRC, 2012; EC, 2020a). Such soils are then degraded, which consequently harms ecosystems and their life support functions. In the case of soil sealing, soil functions are largely and irreversibly lost.",

(2018) updated the definition of soil quality and soil health as 'the capacity of a soil to function within ecosystems and land-use boundaries to sustain biological productivity, maintain environmental quality, and promote plant and animal health'. They distinguish two closely linked dimensions of soil quality: 1. soil capability, i.e., the intrinsic capacity of a soil to contribute to ecosystem services, based on 'inherent' (rather static and less sensitive) attributes of soils versus manageable (dynamic) attributes, according to Schwilch et al. (2016); 2. the capacity of soils to function sustainably (focusing on land use and its impact), including productivity and the soil's contribution to environmental quality, including plant, animal and human health.",

      "text": "A differentiation between soil health and soil quality was supported by Bonfante et al. (2020) and Vogel et al (2020). They define soil health as the actual capacity of a soil to perform its core functions and to provide ecosystem services, and soil quality as the inherent capacity which provides the basic frame within which a soil evolves. Vogel et al. (2020) also define intrinsic 'soil potential' as the maximum functionality a soil can offer based on its inherent properties. This entails an optimum state (condition) of soil based on sustainable management (best use of its properties). This is the basis for a third dimension of soil quality: 3. the dynamic element of soil quality, which characterises the actual state of soils and is based on sensitive (responsive), manageable soil attributes.",

      "text": "SOM is the sum of all dead organic components at various stages of decomposition in a soil, which are made from basic elements including carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and an array of attached cations and ions. Some definitions also include undecayed plant and animal residues as well as microbial biomass. Since SOM is difficult to measure directly, it is common practice to measure and report SOC. Historically, a factor of 1.724 has been used to convert SOC to SOM, based on the assumption that organic matter is 58% carbon. However, a review by Pribyl (2010) shows that a factor of 2 would often be more accurate, especially in the case of soil layers rich in organic matter, such as on forest floors, because of differences related to the different stages of decomposition and mineralisation. To avoid such uncertainties, we recommend not converting at all but using SOC as measured.",
