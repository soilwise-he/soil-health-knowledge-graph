> **Make soil healthy again: Construction of ontology‑compliant soil health knowledge graph with large language models**
> *B. Wang, L. Moreira de Sousa & A. Fensel*

## ✨ Abstract

Soil health is fundamental to environmental sustainability and food security, yet relevant knowledge remains fragmented across diverse sources, hindering its effective application. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a robust solution by integrating disparate information into a structured, semantically rich format. Addressing this need, this paper presents an ontology-compliant **soil health knowledge graph** (SHKG) derived from domain literature, and the semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline developed to construct it. Our pipeline leverages **large language models** (LLMs) to accelerate knowledge extraction, while incorporating expert oversight to ensure ontological compliance and accuracy. The resulting KG integrates unstructured knowledge into **11,715 RDF triples** representing **2,018 entities**, including **1,786 soil-related concepts**. The KG's fidelity was confirmed by soil scientists through a validation process involving competency questions. We demonstrate the KG's primary use case as the backbone for a knowledge discovery system in soil science. The KG, supporting ontology, and the source code of the pipeline are available here.

## 📚 Knowledge Sources

This work draws on the following primary resources:

* **EEA (2023).** *Soil monitoring in Europe – Indicators and thresholds for soil health assessments*.  
* **EEA (2024).** *The state of soils in Europe – Fully evidenced, spatially organised assessment of the pressures driving soil degradation*.

---

## 🧩 Conceptual Model

The high‑level structure of the SHKG follows the conceptual model from the EEA 2023 report (Figure 1.1). We have RDF‑ized this model into our top-level schema:

* **RDF representation**: see [`top_level_KG.ttl`](top_level_KG.ttl)

## 🛠️ Pipeline of KG Construction

We utilized a pipeline that incorporates LLMs for the extraction of relevant information from the source text, followed by post-processing and alignment with established ontologies:

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone** this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soilwise-he/soil-health-knowledge-graph.git
   cd soil-health-knowledge-graph
   ```

2. **Install** dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the KG**

   * Load the main graph in Python or any RDF tool:

     ```python
     from rdflib import Graph
     g = Graph().parse("soil_health_KG.ttl", format="turtle")
     print(len(g), "triples loaded")
     ```

   * Run example SPARQL queries in `example_sparql_queries/` or via the public endpoint at:
     [https://repository.soilwise-he.eu/sparql/](https://repository.soilwise-he.eu/sparql/)

4. **Run the pipeline**
   Open and run `KGC_pipeline.ipynb` to see:

   * LLM‑driven triple generation (via GPT‑4o prompts)
   * Turtle syntax check & repair
   * Ontology alignment, entity normalization & relation disambiguation
   * KG enrichment (invertible relations, external vocabularies)
   * KG validation
   * Example SoilWise knowledge repository (interlink with harvested Zenodo metadata records)

## 🔗 Imported Ontologies & Schemas

To ensure our soil health KG aligns with recognized standards, we incorporate a variety of well-established ontologies and schemes.

* [SKOS Core](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html)
* [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/)
* [RDF Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)
* [Agrontology](https://aims.fao.org/aos/agrontology)
* [Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO)](https://sio.semanticscience.org/)
* [Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO)](https://obofoundry.org/)
* [QUDT](https://qudt.org/)
* [Ontology of Units of Measure (OM)](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/)
* [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/)
* [Schema.org](https://schema.org/)
* [SWEET ontology](http://sweetontology.net/)
* [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)
* [Biolink Model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/)

* [REPRODUCE-ME Ontology](https://w3id.org/reproduceme)
* [BioAssay Ontology (BAO)](http://bioassayontology.org/)
* [Time Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/)

The KG leverages **19 classes** and **205 properties** drawn from above ontologies to formally define the types of entities and their relationships. All 19 classes come from existing ontologies, while **45** of the 205 properties are defined by us and the rest come from existing ontologies.

## 🔗 Linked Vocabularies & Thesauri

The KG is enriched by interlinking to controlled vocabularies and thesauri in the field of soil science to align with standard terminologies.

* [AGROVOC](http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc)
* [ISO 11074:2025](https://data.geoscience.earth/ncl/ISO11074v2025)
