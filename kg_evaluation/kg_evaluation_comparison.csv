"What are the main functional groups of the soil food web, and what are some of the described characteristics for each group, including their feeding habits and approximate ranges for size, density, and biomass?","The main functional groups of the soil food web are as follows: Earthworms consume plant residues and soil including (micro)organisms. Often, they form the major part of the soil fauna biomass with up to 1,000 individuals per m², 3,000kg fresh biomass per hectare or a few hundred kilograms of carbon (C) per hectare; Enchytraeids (pot worms) are relatives of earthworms with a much smaller size and a similar diet. Their densities vary between 100/m² and 10⁶/m², with a biomass of up to 1kg C/ha; Mites (fungivores, bacterivores, predators) have a size of about 1mm, densities of about 10⁵/m² and a biomass of up to 0.1 kg C/ha; Springtails or Collembola (fungivores, omnivores) also have a size of about 1mm.
