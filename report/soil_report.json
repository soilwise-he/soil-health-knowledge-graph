This usually requires models that describe the behaviour of a soil under stress and help to define thresholds. The key principle underlying this approach is that critical limits (thresholds) in endpoints (e.g. water quality, human health, ecosystem functioning) are converted into equivalent thresholds (or screening values) in soil.

An example of this is the commonly observed accumulation of heavy metals in soil. In most arable cropping systems where animal manure is applied, copper and zinc tend to accumulate in soil. Accumulation may be desirable in the case of adding nutrients, such as phosphorus (P) in a situation where phosphorus is limited, but it is considered unwanted in phosphorus-saturated soils or when adding toxic pollutants (e.g. cadmium).

At present, assessment of soil degradation according to the current state of research, can be carried out only for specific soil services.

It also includes soil excavation and soil sealing.\n•\tSoil chemical degradation is characterised by changes in soil processes, including nutrient depletion, acidification, salinisation and contamination, which in turn leads to a reduced cation exchange capacity, increased aluminium or manganese toxicities, calcium or magnesium deficiencies, and leaching of nitrate nitrogen or other essential plant nutrients. For nutrients and contaminants, annual inputs, such as those from agricultural management (inputs of N, P, K and also copper, zinc, cadmium and antibiotics via animal manure, sewage sludge, compost, digestate or mineral fertilisers) or from additional sources, including inputs via air or sedimentation, are also considered chemical degradation.\n•\tSoil biological degradation refers to reduced soil biological activity, which can be accompanied by a loss of soil biodiversity. This leads to lower levels of mineralisation and respiration and an accumulation of incompletely decomposed dead organic matter (necromass). Nutrient availability is reduced, and organic matter accumulates in forest topsoils. In peat soils, degradation (cause by drainage) leads to SOC losses.\n•\tSoil ecological degradation: although a clear characterisation of soil ecological condition, and what is to be considered a reference, is largely lacking, ecological degradation reflects a combination of the other three types of degradation.

This is because complex biochemical processes are involved in SOC turnover, including mineralisation and stabilisation. In addition, soil and environmental conditions vary profoundly across Europe. The SOC content reflects an interplay between vegetation, climate and soil; depending on the chemical composition of SOC, its binding with soil minerals and its storage within soil aggregates, SOC content can respond rapidly to climatic changes or changes induced by land management, in particular its labile fraction. Nowadays, a natural equilibrium under undisturbed conditions is rarely seen; however, the thresholds for the lowest SOC contents necessary to ensure soil health are barely understood. This makes it difficult to determine the level at which soils are degraded as a result of loss of SOC content. In this chapter, several approaches to defining such thresholds are summarised.

Hence, SOM also affects the storage and release of nutrients and heavy metals, and it contributes to soil acidity (forest floors, Podsols) or its buffering (Blume et al., 2016).

Nitrogen affects the composition of microbial communities (e.g. proportion of fungi and bacteria), root turnover and the chemical composition of SOM. SOM (research is nowadays focused on SOC) is thus an important indicator to regulate the need for nitrogenous fertilisers. SOM may become a source of nitrogen, particularly during winter in agricultural fields, while the presence of SOM with a higher C/N ratio may also contribute to minimising environmental pollution (Musinguzi et al., 2013) due to microbial immobilisation processes. The C/N ratio of SOM finally affects the need for fertiliser nitrogen (Schjønning et al., 2018) as well as dissolved organic matter formation (Kindler et al., 2011) and nitrous oxide release (Mu et al., 2009). Establishing critical SOM (or SOC) levels or thresholds may help to restore SOC-depleted (and nitrogen-depleted) soils.

Historically, a factor of 1.724 has been used to convert SOC to SOM, based on the assumption that organic matter is 58% carbon. However, a review by Pribyl (2010) shows that a factor of 2 would often be more accurate, especially in the case of soil layers rich in organic matter, such as on forest floors, because of differences related to the different stages of decomposition and mineralisation.

As POM is more susceptible to decomposition and thus loss, assessing these SOC pools helps in determining C sequestration potential and in monitoring SOC in response to management actions (see also Christensen, 1992; Lavallee et al., 2020).

Regarding the stone content, it is often neglected in agricultural topsoils; however, following recommendations made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2006), it is good practice to quantify carbon stocks in subsoils in order to quantify the amount of carbon vertically redistributed and the part lost (or gained) in the local soil under investigation. For this reason, the weights, or volumes, of fine gravel (inside the sampling cylinders for determining bulk density), coarse gravel and stones need to be estimated, in particular for non-agricultural soils and SOC estimates at greater depths."

In addition, the available research on thresholds frequently excludes non-agricultural land uses. Nevertheless, the effects of soil management and the derivation of SOC thresholds for sustainable (arable) soil management have usually focused on the effect of the decline in SOC levels on crop yield. This focus on yield benefits means that farmers are more likely to accept changes in management practices (e.g. Amelung et al., 2020). Yet, crop yield is also the result of the interaction of many factors, in particular soil fertility, for which SOM and nutrient availability are as important as sufficient water. Hence, correlations between SOC content and yields are not always clear, and the same applies to effects of organic matter additions to yield development (Hijbeek et al., 2017a; Vonk et al., 2020)."

The yields of these two crops are on average higher with higher concentrations of SOC, with yield increases levelling off at 2% SOC (Oldfield et al., 2019). Significant correlations between SOM and soil productivity have also been found for cereals, even when fertiliser is applied (Pan et al., 2009). For rice, SOM content is positively correlated with yield, and this explains up to 70% of the yield under fertilization regime (Zhao et al., 2016). While these studies are often local, they nevertheless suggest globally valid thresholds for SOC-yield relationships. Loveland and Webb (2003) conclude that quantitative evidence for single thresholds in relation to crop yields is difficult to find. Rather, any typical SOC content can be determined only if specific soil, management and climatic conditions are considered. Given the diversity of soils and growing factors, a universal value for a critical minimum SOC level may not be appropriate (Goulding et al., 2013). It is possible that relationships between SOC and yield are crop, soil and/or region specific. Nevertheless, and even if the thresholds are also region specific and depend on, for example, soil texture, there are to our knowledge no indications in the literature yet that would support a SOC-induced yield improvement above the 2% SOC level."

Such values can be taken from more or less undisturbed soils under natural vegetation (e.g. forests) or modelled, which would theoretically represent the highest SOC stock a given soil can achieve ('reference SOC stocks', according to Batjes (2011)). Yet, taking this approach, nearly all arable soils would be classified as degraded, because SOC is inevitably lost when breaking a native sod. Barré et al.

For New Zealand, Sparling et al. (2003) proposed the median SOC for permanent grassland as a target value, and its 25th percentile as a minimum value. This is a pragmatic solution and can be easily determined. The 25th percentile is conservative and seems quite realistic. An example of derive modelled reference SOC stocks is Lugato et al.

They proposed that the optimum SOC content was 10% of the clay content, later specified by others as dispersible clay rather than total clay (e.g. Schjønning et al., 2012). This threshold was refined by Johannes et al. (2017), based on 161 samples representing a major part of the Swiss agricultural land (cambic luvisols) (Table 2.7). The threshold translates into a vulnerability limit: %SOC = 0.1*%clay. Prout et al.

Nevertheless, it seems that the SOC/clay ratio as an indicator of good soil structure applies to a wide range of soils and land uses (arable land, grassland and woodland), and can be used to monitor and understand the state of soils at larger scales. For England and Wales, Prout et al. (2020) found that 38.2%, 6.6% and 5.6% of arable, grassland and woodland sites, respectively, were degraded as a result of loss of SOC.

These findings were taken further by Wiesmeier et al. (2014), who reported significant amounts of carbon stored in the >20µm fraction (>20% in the analysed literature, 40-60% in his study). Moreover, a more recent report by Lawrence et al. (2018) stresses that it is the fine fraction carbon that should be used as an indicator of soils' capacity to stabilise carbon. Six et al.

Stewart et al. (2007) concluded that the greatest efficiency of soil carbon sequestration will occur in soils far from carbon saturation. This applies to nearly all arable soils. However, considering that a large proportion of the additional increase in SOC (e.g. through carbon farming and elevated carbon inputs) might also occur in coarse soil fractions such as POM (Gulde et al., 2008), and considering that this SOC is less stable, any such newly stored SOC may be rapidly lost if the change in farming practice is not sustained."

In addition, it affects the diversity of soil microorganisms, soil animals and plant species, which can be positive or negative. In general, a high nitrogen status reduces the diversity but the increase in other nutrients may either increase or decrease diversity.

In non-agricultural systems (i.e. forestry), biomass growth is thus enhanced by additional inputs. At a certain level, however, this production increase will also adversely affect plant species diversity, and it may cause losses of N and P to water, where they may cause eutrophication (see Section 3.1.3), and growth may even be reduced at very high levels of inputs (see Section 3.1.2). In agricultural soils, crop growth is strongly stimulated by N and P fertiliser and manure inputs, but the risk of N and P losses to water and the related impacts of eutrophication is high.

While there is usually a chemical equilibrium between available and reactive ions and those in the soil solution (a prerequisite for deriving thresholds based on simple nutrient concentration analysis), no such equilibrium exists for N. Instead, biologically mediated processes affect the availability of N to crops in agricultural soils. Important soil parameters affecting soil N availability include pH, organic matter and clay content. When N is added to soil, a part is consumed by vegetation, and the N surplus is emitted to air, as ammonia (NH₃), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N₂O) or dinitrogen (N₂), or to groundwater and surface water, mainly as nitrate (NO₃⁻), or it accumulates in soil (Figure 3.1); however, the long-term change in the stock of organic soil N is very limited.

A meta-analysis of the yield response to long-term phosphorous fertilisation from 30 field experiments in Germany and Austria showed a strong decline in the magnitude of the yield response with increasing soil P content, with no effect at high soil P status (Buczko et al., 2018).

In agricultural systems, N inputs from fertiliser and manure thus mainly affect crop yield, thereby also increasing the carbon (C) input by crop residues. On the other hand, soil N input may enhance soil C decomposition, and it has been claimed that inorganic N fertiliser leads to a decline in both the organic C (Khan et al., 2007) and organic N (Mulvaney et al., 2009) content based on an analysis of soil C and N data from long-term field experiments. However, both assessments were heavily criticised in the literature (Reid, 2008; Powlson et al., 2010) and there are various data sets indicating that enhanced N inputs lead to an increase in soil C in agricultural soils with N limitation (Amelung et al., 2020)."

They concluded that plant P demand was fully satisfied by uptake from soil P reserves accumulated from previous soil P applications in excess of plant demand. This critical P level is affected, however, by soil properties such as clay and organic matter content and also by climatic variables, such as temperature (Buczko et al., 2018; Hirte et al., 2021).

Increased N deposition often thus stimulates forest growth and hence C sequestration (Högberg, 2007; De Vries et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2010), considering that in forests SOC decomposition is often reduced in response to (high) N deposition (e.g. Janssens et al., 2010).The N-induced increase in growth can be diminished, however, when the accompanying P supply is deficient (Braun et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015; Lang et al., 2016). Soil P availability in terrestrial ecosystems is primarily driven by mineral weathering and atmospheric deposition (Vitousek et al., 2010). P input from atmospheric deposition is low, and this also holds for weathering, which is also generally low. Newman (1995) reviewed P deposition and weathering in global terrestrial ecosystems and estimated a range of 0.07-1.7kg/ha/year for P deposition and 0.01-1.0kg/ha/year for P weathering, indicating that both fluxes are in the same order of magnitude."

N addition thus seems to accelerate decomposition of low-lignin 'easily degradable' litter but to reduce decomposition rates of high-lignin 'recalcitrant' substrates.

At high soil C/N ratios, most incoming N is retained by microbial immobilisation and limited N is available to plants. When more N is stored, the C/N ratio declines, and more N becomes available by mineralisation for plant uptake and leaching. Based on the relationship between N leaching and the C/N ratio in the organic layer of forests, C/N ratios of around 25 (between 20 and 30) are considered critical, with a very high N retention fraction and thus limited leaching risk at a C/N ratio above 30, while the N retention fraction is low and the leaching risk is high at a C/N ratio below 20; in between, there is strong variation as shown in Table 3.2."

Using a data set of published N budgets and C/N ratios in the organic layer, MacDonald et al.

Nowadays, the most significant effect is seen on unlimed agricultural land as a result of the application of ammonium-based fertilisers and urea, especially on naturally acidic soils such as sandy soils. This is because ammonium nitrogen is readily converted to nitrate and hydrogen ions, and its presence decreases the availability of plant nutrients, such as phosphorus, calcium and magnesium (base cations).

In non-calcareous acidic soils (pH between 4.5 and 7.0), base cation nutrients, i.e. calcium (Ca²⁺), magnesium (Mg²⁺) and potassium (K⁺), adsorbed onto soil organic matter and clay, are crucial in buffering the protons produced by elevated nitrogen inputs (De Vries et al., 2015b). During acidification, these base cations are replaced by protons and subsequently leached from the rooting zone, accompanied by nitrate (De Vries et al., 1989; Lucas et al., 2011), which decreases their availability. This is an adverse effect, since this loss of base cations implies a loss of the acid neutralisation capacity, and it may affect plant growth at low base saturation levels (i.e. the ratio of adsorbed base cations on clay and organic matter to the cation exchange capacity). At very low pH levels, there is not only more limited availability of base cation nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, but also elevated concentrations of toxic elements, such as aluminium, manganese and toxic metals, such as cadmium, which can restrict plant and soil biota growth due to nutrient deficiency and metal toxicity (Rengel, 1992; Kochian et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007). In addition, pH can also affect the availability of zinc with available zinc increasing at low pH (pH < 5.5) and, conversely, a lower availability or even deficit at pH levels higher than pH 7. For phosphorus the impact of pH on availability is more complex and plant availability decreases both at low (pH < 5) and high (pH > 6-7) due to interaction and precipitation with iron and aluminium (at low pH) and calcium at high pH (Barrow, 2017). There are indications that crop growth can be limited in acidic soils (Lucas and Davis, 1961; Baquy et al., 2017). Aluminium toxicity is a major constraint for crop production in highly acidic soils (pH<4.5) by damaging and stunting root systems (Delhaize and Ryan, 1995; Kochian et al., 2015) and potentially decreasing the availability of phosphate by forming aluminium-phosphorus precipitates (Hinsinger, 2001)."

In calcareous soils, the input of acidifying compounds (nitrogen and sulphur) will not change soil pH until almost all the calcium carbonate has been depleted. In these soils, protons (H⁺) are buffered by the dissolution of bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) and calcium (Ca²⁺) from calcium carbonate, with HCO₃⁻ and Ca²⁺ ions leaching from the system, while the pH remains the same. In non-calcareous soils, buffering is taken over by the weathering of silicate minerals and by the cation exchange processes of the soil adsorption complexes. In these soils, protons are exchanged for calcium (Ca²⁺), magnesium (Mg²⁺) and potassium (K⁺), and these cations are leached from the soil together with anions (mostly nitrate or sulphate). Subsequent leaching of Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ and K⁺ leads to loss of the soil's base cation buffering capacity and to imbalances in the nutrients needed for plant growth. Because of the restricted capacity of this buffering system, soil pH will decrease. It has been shown that acid deposition in many forested catchments has caused prolonged export of base cations, such as Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, from forest soils, resulting in base cation nutrient depletion (Watmough et al., 2005; Sverdrup et al., 2006; Akselsson et al., 2007). When the soil pH drops below 4.5, the acid input is also buffered by aluminium release, causing aluminium toxicity.

The effects of high concentrations of aluminium on trees were tested with seedlings, grown in water cultures, in pot trials (greenhouse), mainly in the 1980s (see Rengel (1992) and Kinraide (2003) for overviews). The hypothesised mechanisms of aluminium toxicity include hampered root growth and inhibition of the uptake of nutrients (Schulze, 1989; Sverdrup et al., 1990, 1992; Sverdrup and Warfvinge, 1993; Warfvinge et al., 1993; Matzner and Murach, 1995). Furthermore, several authors (e.g. Roelofs et al., 1985) showed that release of aluminium by soil acidification and imbalances in the ratio of ammonium to base cations, due to excessive nitrogen inputs and reduced nitrification, may cause nutrient deficiencies, which may be aggravated by a loss of mycorrhiza or plant root damage. This coincided temporally with field observations and foliage analyses in which deficiencies of magnesium and potassium caused yellowing of the needles in Norway spruce (Zöttl and Mies, 1983). In the 1980s, several authors (e.g. Ulrich and Pankrath, 1983; Hutchinson et al., 1986) considered soil acidification, especially the increase in the concentration of Al³⁺ in soil solution, responsible for forest decline, since Al³⁺ is very likely to be toxic to plant roots (Marschner, 1990; Mengel, 1991; Sverdrup and Warfvinge, 1992; Cronan and Grigal 1995).

Studies showed that the plant response can be described better as a function of the base cation and Al concentration in soil solution than as a function of Al alone or of the Al/Ca ratio. The critical limit was most conveniently expressed as a molar Bc/Al_tot ratio, with Al_tot being the total (inorganic and organically complexed) aluminium concentration and Bc denoting the base cations Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ and K⁺. Many calculations of critical loads of acid deposition on forest ecosystems use either a general limit value of 1 for the Bc/Al ratio or a tree species specific value, ranging between 0.5 and 2.0."

In addition, whole-ecosystem experiments, designed to test the effects of acid deposition on forests (Abrahamsen et al., 1993; Beier et al., 1998; Kreutzer and Weiss, 1998; Huber et al., 2004), have been inconclusive with respect to the effects of aluminium toxicity on root growth and nutrient uptake.

Essential soil functions, such as the production of sufficient and safe food and the provision of clean water and a suitable habitat for soil dwelling organisms, can be impaired depending on the degree of soil pollution. To be able to assess the impact of soil pollution on soil health, meaningful indicators for the current state of soils and the associated risks from pollutants, as well as information about inputs and outputs of substances, are required. Once critical concentrations are exceeded, relevant soil functions can be impaired. To derive meaningful thresholds for pollutants in soil, the entire pathway — from emissions of pollutants to exposure — needs to be considered. This includes inputs to and outputs from soil, as well as processes that regulate concentrations in soil and adjacent relevant environmental compartments (e.g. water). This chapter provides an overview of some of the existing approaches for setting such thresholds, currently developed largely at national level. Options for harmonising thresholds are discussed, also emphasising the need for improved harmonising of risk assessment tools as a basis for soil screening values and risk assessment procedures."

Both stability and mobility are part of the registration procedure (aside from toxicity testing as such), and in most European countries the application and leaching of PPPs is regulated (type of chemical to be used as well as its application (Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009; EU, 2009).

For example, in the case of exposure via food, the intake of chemicals such as Hg or As is largely determined by the quality of crops (including their processing and transport). In the case of $H g}$ and As, the intake is largely controlled by the quality of seafood. A study on the contribution of Cd in food products grown in the EU by Rietra et al. (2017), for example, revealed that approximately $55\\%$ of the total intake of Cd via food was related to the Cd concentration in the soil. And lowering the average Cd concentration in the soil by $50\\%$ would result in an $18\\%$  reduction in the total intake of Cd. This shows that intake from food is relevant for human exposure to Cd and that this exposure can be related to soil quality. However, research has revealed that the relationships between Cd in soils and uptake by crops are complex and not always consistent for different crops and/or soil types. At present, only a few reliable models are available for use in risk assessment (e.g. those for wheat, rice and a selected number of vegetables). For most other metals and most organic pollutants, reliable soil to crop transfer models are not (yet) available. "

For each of the services considered, specific protection targets (or endpoints) can be described. The exposure of each protection target or endpoint is then related to different exposure pathways (from soil to endpoint). For example, in the case of arable cropping systems, human exposure is related to the concentration of pollutants in the harvested product and the total amount consumed. This procedure has been used to derive critical limits in food for a selected number of pollutants, for example Cd, Pb and As and selected organic compounds regulated by Commission Regulation (EC No) 1881/2006 (EU, 2006; with revisions for Cd (EU, 2021a) and Pb (EU, 2021b)). For groundwater and surface waters, exposure results from the direct consumption of polluted water as drinking water. The quantification of the role of soils in exposure assessments requires knowledge of the transport route of substances through the percolating soil solution (retention processes), from the (top)soil towards deeper soil layers or underlying water bodies.

In the case of point source pollution, the chemical quality of soils can be such that immediate action is required or, perhaps better, assessment tools should be able to detect where action is immediately required in order to reduce the risks to human and/or ecosystem health. For soils affected by diffuse pollution, however, the current health of most soils is not yet affected to such an extent that it poses an immediate threat. However, continuing the current inputs from diffuse sources (either the atmosphere or direct inputs from land use) can lead to critical pollutant levels being exceeded. This requires a different approach from that applied for point source pollution. "

For example, the current soil concentrations of copper and zinc in the Netherlands in terms of ecological risks are not of concern in the majority of arable soils (De Vries et al., 2004; Groenenberg et al., 2006). However, due to the rather high concentrations of both elements in manure (Römkens and Rietra, 2008; Deltares, 2018) and high application rates of manure in the Netherlands, both copper and zinc levels in soil are expected to increase because of the positive balance in most arable cropping systems. This in turn will lead to an exceedance of the critical threshold levels (SSVs) for both metals over time in terms of ecosystem functioning (De Vries et al., 2004 Groeneberg et al., 2006). The speed at which accumulation (or depletion) occurs depends on the combination of the load to soil and removal rate from the soil, which in turn depends on soil properties such as pH and organic matter. This means that accumulation is faster in high pH soils or soils rich in organic matter or clay. On the other hand, the risk of an increase in concentrations in groundwater "

At present, most thresholds consider the critical endpoint to be protected, usually human health and/or the (soil) ecosystem. Other endpoints often used are groundwater, drinking water and surface water (Carlon and Swartjes, 2007). In some countries, wildlife, animal products or crops are considered endpoints. Current UK (soil guideline values), German (BMU, 2020) or Dutch SSVs, for example, are based on effects on humans and the ecosystem. Despite the differences in terminology used to address a risk limit or screening level in soil, the SSVs used in these countries do take a common approach in that risk assessment is at the core of the system and SSVs almost always depend on the actual land use. By relating exposure to acceptable exposure (e.g. TDI or excess lifetime cancer risk) of humans $\\binom{22}{2}$ , a human health- based threshold can be derived. in the case of ecosystem protection, the potentially affected fraction of organisms as a risk-based threshold can be derived from species sensitivity distributions (Posthuma and Suter (2011) in the Netherlands; Martin et al.

ISO 19258 (ISO, 2018b), however, defines background concentration as 'concentration of an element or a substance characteristic of a soil type in an area or region arising from both natural sources and anthropogenic diffuse sources such as atmospheric deposition'. It thus also includes contributions from agriculture and even inputs to soils in urban areas and also relates to organic pollutants.

In the Dutch system, for example, background values are determined as the 95th percentile of values taken from 100 sites considered to be barely influenced by anthropogenic activities. The resulting background value, corrected for soil properties (clay and organic matter) is, for practical reasons, considered an acceptable upper level, despite not having been tested for effects on soil organisms, for example. There is much variability among countries, however, in the procedure to derive background values. This includes for example the cut-off percentile used to derive the background value, the population of measuring points and the level of stratification.

In other countries such as the United Kingdom, a similar approach has been established, albeit with different values to represent the standard soil. In the United Kingdom, for example, an average soil organic matter content of $3.4\\%$ is used as well as different ranges in soil parameters such as pH. In some countries, SSVs obtained for ecology are further corrected for the geochemical background (Martin et al., 2022), which results in a marked variability in the final SSV even within the country. In Wallonia, eight different soil standards are used because of the large variety of soil types encountered, including anthroposols (i.e. backfilled soils) (Goidts et al., 2018). "

While an enormous number of soil-dwelling species are still undescribed, experimental evidence is also lacking for the critical role of functionally relevant (flagship) species and the effects of their loss. Rather than net species numbers, research is currently focusing on the interactions between functional groups of organisms and their abiotic environment.

To assess the level of biodiversity below which soil functioning would be hampered, several authors suggest the determination of threshold values (Van der Heijden et al., 1998; Liiri et al., 2002; Setälä and McLean, 2004; FAO and ITPS, 2015). However, first, a clear relationship between biodiversity parameters and indicators for specific soil functions must be established (Van Leeuwen et al., 2017). This begins with setting clear objectives for the quality criteria of individual ecosystem services for specific ecosystems and ends with the selection of the most appropriate indicator organism group(s) or species.

Agricultural intensification not only changes the diversity of individual groups of soil biota, it also reduces the complexity of soil food webs and the community-related biomass of soil fauna (Tsiafouli et al., 2015) and the interaction network between soil bacteria (Karimi et al., 2019). Furthermore, soil faunal communities have fewer and taxonomically more closely related species, indicating reduced soil biodiversity. Bloem et al. (2006b) found that microbial biomass, microbial activity (respiration) and the number of soil fauna functional groups tend to be greater on organic and extensively managed farms. This observation is in line with the expectation that reduced physical and chemical impacts on the soil support the development of highly diverse soil organism communities (including an increase in abundance and biomass). For example, the number and diversity of species in the soil food web, such as nematodes, generally decreases with increased land use and management intensity. In some cases this happens intentionally; for example, applying an intensive rotation will decrease the abundance of potentially harmful organisms such as phytophagous nematodes. However, in general, intensive land use affects soil food webs negatively: diversity decreases — even individual body mass may decrease as larger organisms (such as earthworms) are worse affected than smaller ones (Tsiafouli et al., 2015). In the medium term (up to 4 years) under organic management, earthworms are found at two or three times the level found in conventionally managed fields (Blakemore, 2018). Because the relationship between management regime and soil biota is fairly stable across regions, agricultural policies may be steered to halt and/ or reverse this loss of soil biodiversity.\n "

This overview of the mean rates for the whole of Europe masks the fact that the environmental and climatic conditions and management practices vary widely at the continental scale, leading to considerable differences in the magnitude and importance of the different types of soil erosion in different locations. For example, gully erosion in the Mediterranean region can account for $10-80\\%$  of total erosion on cultivated and grazed land, whereas water erosion can clearly dominate in temperate areas where erosive rainfall events are less frequent and intense (Boardman and Poesen, 2006). As discussed by Kuhwald et al. (2022), soil erosion by crop harvesting is important in regions with a large proportion of tuber and root crops in the rotation. In such hot spots, soil loss due to harvesting can be of the same magnitude as water and wind erosion. To be reliable and relevant, Europe-wide monitoring schemes need to address these regional differences in the importance and magnitude of the different types of erosion. The type of soil erosion that prevails under specific climatic conditions or management practices (e.g. growing tuber or root crops) can be most effectively monitored. "

Considering the typically slow rates of natural soil formation from weathering and other processes, estimated to be 0.05-0.5mm/year (Wakatsuki and Rasyidin, 1992, cited in Gobin et al., 2004), any soil loss of more than 1t/ha/year can be considered irreversible.

This reduces hydraulic conductivity and rainwater infiltration, which reduces groundwater recharge, while increasing the likelihood of waterlogging. The last hampers rooting and soil biological activity. Consequently, soil biochemical processes are affected, including nutrient turnover and greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide, methane). As a result, plant health, and thus food and fibre production, are adversely affected. Compaction is also known to trigger soil erosion. Operations at critical soil moisture levels, and the use of increasingly heavy machinery, cause compaction, which is particularly damaging in the subsoil. While topsoil compaction can be ameliorated through tillage and bioturbation from plants rooting and soil fauna burrowing, subsoil compaction is cumulative, often persistent and requires significant technical effort to alleviate.

Seasonal time constraints (e.g. independent of the current soil moisture level), but also the operational conditions and limited knowledge of service providers appear to be additional pressures. An example of the need for specific knowledge are the risks of wheeling- and shearing-induced soil deformation, which depend on the kind of machinery used. The specific damage to soil is conditioned by the machine weight and contact area with the soil, the number of passes and the area covered, but also by shearing and soil smearing from wheel slip (Horn and Peth, 2011; Keller et al., 2019; Horn, 2021; Keller and Or, 2022). It is mainly the high wheel and axle loads of transport vehicles and harvesters that cause mechanical stress on a given contact area and which can exceed the resisting forces within soil: irreversible soil deformation and permanent compaction is the consequence — especially in the subsoil. Such effects are increased when soils are wet and weak and when field traffic efficiency is low (Duttmann et al., 2014). Repeated trafficking generally results in cumulative soil compaction to deeper soil depths and induces subsoil deformation of the pores and their functions if a given soil strength is exceeded by the applied stresses.

Schroeder et al. (2022a) found that, based on the analysis of more than 500 soil profiles between 1980 and 2022, the formation of a platy structure in the subsoil increased, while the saturated hydraulic conductivity or air permeability decreased to values below a threshold.

Any natural ameliorative measures to improve soil functions and crop yield require not only more sensitive (conservation) tillage management but also time. For example, natural drying induces crack formation and root penetration into deeper soil layers, and vertical pores are formed and inhabited by earthworms. It takes decades before soil structure is visibly improved as a result of such processes. So-called subsoiling, or deep ploughing, carries the risk of completely weakening the soil structure through homogenisation. "

Thus, both topsoil and subsoil are affected. The subsoil in agriculture is defined as soil below the tillage depth (usually around 20-35cm). However, while compaction in the topsoil can be mitigated through effective management \n (e.g. ploughing or chiselling) or through natural processes \n (e.g. soil biota activity, swelling and shrinkage), the damage to the subsoil is particularly relevant since, at these depths, compaction is cumulative and persistent over decades or maybe even centuries (Keller et al., 2019). Note that the often assumed 'curing' effect of freeze-thaw cycles are less effective in the subsoil (Hartge and Horn, 2016). Subsoil compaction is hence the main factor responsible for soil degradation, having a persistent impact on soil functions "

The values for the precompression stress and the stress-dependent changes in these properties and functions are determined under laboratory conditions and often quantified when the soil is most sensitive (usually in early spring at matric potential values of $p F1.8}=.60h P a})$ , or when drying due to evapotranspiration reduces the soil water content (pF2.5 or -300hPa matric potential).

Anthropogenic compaction is found if the selected compaction-sensitive parameters — air capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity — are larger in the subsoil than in the topsoil or if the saturated hydraulic conductivity in soil horizons with originally pedogenetically greater values now have values smaller than those in the deeper and more dense soil horizons  (e.g. in stagnic luvisols and luvisols).

The risk assessment is based on the CVT approach and considers changes in mechanical properties as they depend on the matric potential (Rücknagel et al., 2015). With the help of GPS (global positioning system) data recorded by all farm vehicles involved in tillage, spraying and harvesting, the data serve to map wheeling intensity, and allow the spatially explicit mapping of scenarios for different wheel loads and predicted contact area stress. These data can subsequently be used for modelling soil compaction risk. Coupling the two models, FiTraM and SaSCiA, allows estimation of the spatially distributed soil compaction risk in the topsoil and in the subsoil, and even considers single field operations; it can also spatially specify the actual soil compaction and deformation status.

In that study, the potential and actual delivery of soil functions is predicted using static and dynamic soil properties, which are then scored to compare the performance of different soils. Among other functions, Vogel et al. (2020) also include the water storage function, which is not covered in this report. This is also one of the four functions investigated by Steinhoff-Knopp et al.

The loss of soil functions can affect the health and survival of organisms living in and from the soil, including humans, which derive food from the soil and are in daily contact with it. Thresholds, i.e. critical limits, play an important role in understanding where soil functions have been harmed to a level that needs prevention, restoration or remediation; this can be indicated by the degree to which critical limits are exceeded, as shown in Figure 1.3. The loss of soil function may be indicated by reduced plant production (e.g. yield loss), reduced soil biodiversity or loss of soil stability (soil losses through erosion and landslides).
